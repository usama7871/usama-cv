# Usama's CV Website 📄

Welcome to the source code for my personal curriculum vitae website. This repository holds the files necessary to build and deploy a simple, static web page showcasing my professional background, skills, and projects.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
These instructions will help you run the project locally and understand its structure.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Optional: a local web server such as `http-server`, `python -m http.server`, or similar for testing

### Contents
The repository contains the following files:

- `index.html` – main HTML page
- `style.css` – stylesheet for appearance
- `script.js` – JavaScript for interactive behavior
- `README.md` – this guide

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usama7871/usama-cv.git
   cd usama-cv
   ```
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve it with a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   # or
   npx http-server .
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the site.

## 🛠️ Customization
Feel free to modify the files to personalize the CV:

- **Edit `index.html`** to change text, add sections, or update contact information.
- **Update `style.css`** to adjust colors, fonts, or layout.
- **Modify `script.js`** if you add interactive elements (e.g., smooth scrolling, modals).

For major changes, consider installing a build step or templating system (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo) if you expand beyond a static page.
